					<h1 id="title">Superman</h1>
					<p>Superman is a fictional superhero owned by DC Comics. He was created by writer, Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster in 1933. He debuted in the comic, Action Comics #1 in June, 1938. Superman helped to create the superhero archetype and establish its primacy within the American comic book. His alter ego is Clark Kent. The character is also referred to by such epithets as the Man of Steel, the Man of Tomorrow, and The Last Son of Krypton.</p>
					<p>The origin story of Superman relates that he was born Kal-El on the alien planet Krypton, before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor-El, moments before Krypton's destruction. Discovered and adopted by a Kansas farm couple, the child is raised as Clark Kent and imbued with a strong moral compass. Very early on he started to display various superhuman abilities, which, upon reaching maturity, he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity through a secret "Superman" identity.</p>
					<p>Superman resides and operates in the fictional American city of Metropolis. As Clark Kent, he is a journalist for the Daily Planet, a Metropolis newspaper. Superman's love interest is generally Lois Lane, and his archenemy is supervillain Lex Luthor. He is typically a member of the Justice League and close ally of Batman and Wonder Woman. Like other characters in the DC Universe, several alternate versions of Superman have been depicted over the years.</p>
					<p>Superman's appearance is distinctive and iconic; he usually wears a blue costume with a red-and-yellow emblem on the chest, consisting of the letter S in a shield shape, and a red cape. This shield is used in many media to symbolize the character. Superman is widely considered an American cultural icon. He has fascinated scholars, with cultural theorists, commentators, and critics alike exploring the character's impact and role in the United States and worldwide. The character's ownership has often been the subject of dispute, with Siegel and Shuster twice suing for the return of rights. The character has been adapted extensively and portrayed in other forms of media as well, including films, television series, and video games. Several actors have portrayed Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, and Tyler Hoechlin.</p>

				<h2>DC Extended Universe</h2>
				<p>The DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is an American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series of superhero films, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, based on characters that appear in publications by DC Comics. The shared universe, much like the original DC Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed three films with more than ten in various stages of production. The series has grossed over $2.3 billion at the global box office. The first film released in the DCEU was Man of Steel (2013), a reboot of the Superman film series, which was followed by Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). The next film to be released featuring Superman would be Justice League (2017). </p>
